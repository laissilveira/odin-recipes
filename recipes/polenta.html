    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="description">
        
        <p>Polenta is nothing more than coarsely ground cornmeal. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts water, but I like to measure the polenta just a little scant of a full cup. I often use chicken broth instead of water. It's a great base for any kind of saucy meat or mushroom ragout.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
                <li>1 cup polenta</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
                <li>Â½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan; pour polenta slowly into boiling water, whisking constantly until there are no lumps.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes. When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender.</li>
                    <li>Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until butter partially melts; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes to thicken.</li>
                    <li>Stir polenta and transfer to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and about 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish.</li>
                </ol>
